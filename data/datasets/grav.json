    "description": "Between May 1934 and July 1935, the National Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C. conducted a series of experiments to estimate the acceleration due to gravity, g, at Washington. Each experiment produced a number of replicate estimates of g using the same methodology. Although the basic method remained the same for all experiments, that of the reversible pendulum, there were changes in configuration. \nThe gravity data frame contains the data from all eight experiments. The grav data frame contains the data from the experiments 7 and 8. The data are expressed as deviations from 980.000 in centimetres per second squared. ",
