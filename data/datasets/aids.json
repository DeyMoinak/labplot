  "description": "Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a considerable delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that it is reported. In estimating the prevalence of AIDS, account must be taken of the unknown number of cases which have been diagnosed but not reported. The data set here records the reported cases of AIDS diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992. The data are cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay in the reporting of the cases. ",
