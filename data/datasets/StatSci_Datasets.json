Matui (1968) analysed the position of the 911 houses making up one of those villages. The area studied was a rectangle, 3 km by 4 km. A grid was superimposed over a map of the village, dividing its 12 square kilometres into 1200 plots, each 100 metres on a side. The numbers of houses on each of those plots are recorded in a 30 by 40 matrix of data.",

The students took their own pulse rate. They were then asked to flip a coin. If the coin came up heads, they were to run in place for one minute. Otherwise they sat for one minute. Then everyone took their pulse again. The pulse rates and other physiological and lifestyle data are given in the data. \nFive class groups between 1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. The lecturer, Richard Wilson, was concerned that some students would choose the less strenuous option of sitting rather than running even if their coin came up heads, so in the years 1995-1998 a different method of random assignment was used. In these years, data forms were handed out to the class before the experiment. The forms were pre-assigned to either running or non-running and there were an equal number of each. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned so the numbers running and sitting was still not entirely controlled.",

The times at which 65 successive eruptions occurred from 1340 hours on 12 July 1998 were observed using a digital watch. \nJim Irish writes \nAnyone who has visited the Blowhole more than once knows that the rate and volume of eruptions varies. This variation occurs at several timescales. We might expect that part is explained by the tides, so that eruptions are more frequent and spectacular when the tide is very high, and eruptions obviously depend on the presence of a large ocean swell generated by prolonged strong winds over the ocean well offshore from Kiama. Hence, any stochastic model fitted to data observed over a short period of time is only applicable to that period, and perhaps a few hours either side of the observations. But we might infer from the model fitted to those data that a similar model applies more generally. ",
