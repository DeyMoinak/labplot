              "description": "West of Tokyo lies a large alluvial plain, dotted by a network of farming villages. Matui (1968) analysed the position of the 911 houses making up one of those villages. The area studied was a rectangle, 3 km by 4 km. A grid was superimposed over a map of the village, dividing its 12 square kilometres into 1200 plots, each 100 metres on a side. The numbers of houses on each of those plots are recorded in a 30 by 40 matrix of data.",
