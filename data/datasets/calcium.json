    "description": "Howard Grimes from the Botany Department, North Carolina State University, conducted an experiment for biochemical analysis of intracellular storage and transport of calcium across plasma membrane. Cells were suspended in a solution of radioactive calcium for a certain length of time and then the amount of radioactive calcium that was absorbed by the cells was measured. The experiment was repeated independently with 9 different times of suspension each replicated 3 times. ",
