(1977) at Stanford University. After reaching a stage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients were randomized into two groups. The first group received maintenance chemotherapy and the second group did not. The aim of the study was to see if maintenance chemotherapy increased the length of the remission. The data here formed a preliminary analysis which was conducted in October 1974.",

Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. Patients were followed until the end of 1977. ",

It is common to operate on the patient to get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an accurate assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery. \nFor a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible predictor variables were measured before surgery. The patients then had surgery to determine nodal involvement. It was required to see if nodal involvement could be accurately predicted from the predictor variables and which ones were most important. ",

It contains all three treatment arms and all recurrences for 118 subjects; the maximum observed number of recurrences is 9. \nBladder is the data set that appears most commonly in the literature. It uses only the 85 subjects with nonzero follow-up who were assigned to either thiotepa or placebo, and only the first four recurrences for any patient. The status variable is 1 for recurrence and 0 for everything else (including death for any reason). The data set is laid out in the competing risks format of the paper by Wei, Lin, and Weissfeld. \nBladder2 uses the same subset of subjects as bladder, but formatted in the (start, stop] or Anderson-Gill style. Note that in transforming from the WLW to the AG style data set there is a quite common programming mistake that leads to extra follow-up time for 12 subjects: all those with follow-up beyond their 4th recurrence. This \"follow-up\" is a side effect of throwing away all events after the fourth while retaining the last follow-up time variable from the original data. The bladder2 data set found here does not make this mistake, but some analyses in the literature have done so; it results in the addition of a small amount of immortal time bias and shrinks the fitted coefficients towards zero.

The 37 subjects were women who had a son with mental retardation due to inheriting a defective X-chromosome. For each such mother a genetic measurement of their DNA was made. Larger values of this measurement are known to be linked to the defective gene and it was hypothesized that larger values might also be linked to a progressive shift away from right-handednesss. Each woman also filled in a questionnaire regarding which hand they used for various tasks. From these questionnaires a measure of hand preference was found for each mother. The scale of this measure goes from 1, indicating someone who always favours their right hand, to 8, indicating someone who always favours their left hand. Between these two extremes are people who favour one hand for some tasks and the other for other tasks. ",

His Table III (p. 216) recorded a bivariate frequency distribution of height by finger length. His main purpose was to show that Scotland Yard could have indexed their material more efficiently, and find a given profile more quickly. \nW. S. Gosset (aka \"Student\") used these data in two classic papers in 1908, in which he derived various characteristics of the sampling distributions of the mean, standard deviation and Pearson's r. He said, \"Before I had succeeded in solving my problem analytically, I had endeavoured to do so empirically.\" Among his experiments, he randomly shuffled the 3000 observations from Macdonell's table, and then grouped them into samples of size 4, 8, ..., calculating the sample means, standard deviations and correlations for each sample",

It also showed that the death rate was higher in the first year of the war, before a Sanitary Commissioners arrived in March 1855 to improve hygiene in the camps and hospitals.",

The response is the diameter (mm) of the zone of inhibition of growth of the organism. \nThe data are described in Davies and Goldsmith (1972) as coming from an investigation to “assess the variability between samples of penicillin by the B. subtilis method. In this test method a bulk-inoculated nutrient agar medium is poured into a Petri dish of approximately 90 mm. diameter, known as a plate. When the medium has set, six small hollow cylinders or pots (about 4 mm. in diameter) are cemented onto the surface at equally spaced intervals. A few drops of the penicillin solutions to be compared are placed in the respective cylinders, and the whole plate is placed in an incubator for a given time. Penicillin diffuses from the pots into the agar, and this produces a clear circular zone of inhibition of growth of the organisms, which can be readily measured. The diameter of the zone is related in a known way to the concentration of penicillin in the solution.” ",

His primary example was the relationship between height and forearm length. The data table (cubits) is taken from Galton (1888). Unfortunately, there seem to be some errors in the original data table in that the marginal totals do not match the table. \nSir Francis Galton (1888) published the first demonstration of the correlation coefficient. The regression (or reversion to mediocrity) of the height to the length of the left forearm (a cubit) was found to .8. The original table cubits is taken from Galton (1888). There seem to be some errors in the table as published in that the row sums do not agree with the actual row sums. These data are used to create a matrix using table2matrix for demonstrations of analysis and displays of the data. ",

Each patient had one eye randomized to laser treatment and the other eye received no treatment. For each eye, the event of interest was the time from initiation of treatment to the time when visual acuity dropped below 5/200 two visits in a row. Thus there is a built-in lag time of approximately 6 months (visits were every 3 months). Survival times in this dataset are therefore the actual time to blindness in months, minus the minimum possible time to event (6.5 months).

The original sample contains samples on approximately 2/3 of the residents of Olmsted County aged 50 or greater. \nIn 1995 Dr. Robert Kyle embarked on a study to determine the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) in Olmsted County, Minnesota, a condition which is normally only found by chance from a test (serum electrophoresis) which is ordered for other causes. Later work suggested that one component of immunoglobulin production, the serum free light chain, might be a possible marker for immune disregulation. In 2010 Dr. Angela Dispenzieri and colleagues assayed FLC levels on those samples from the original study for which they had patient permission and from which sufficient material remained for further testing. They found that elevated FLC levels were indeed associated with higher death rates. \nPatients were recruited when they came to the clinic for other appointments, with a final random sample of those who had not yet had a visit since the study began. An interesting side question is whether there are differences between early, mid, and late recruits. \nThis data set contains an age and sex stratified random sample that includes 7874 of the original 15759 subjects. The original subject identifiers and dates have been removed to protect patient identity. Subsampling was done to further protect this information. ",

The number of liver transplants rises over the period, but the number of subjects added to the liver transplant waiting list grew much faster. Important questions addressed by the data are the change in waiting time, who waits, and whether there was an consequent increase in deaths while on the list. \nBlood type is an important consideration. Donor livers from subjects with blood type O can be used by patients with A, B, AB or 0 blood types, whereas an AB liver can only be used by an AB recipient. Thus type O subjects on the waiting list are at a disadvantage, since the pool of competitors is larger for type O donor livers. \nThis data is of historical interest and provides a useful example of competing risks, but it has little relevance to current practice. Liver allocation policies have evolved and now depend directly on each individual patient's risk and need, assessments of which are regularly updated while a patient is on the waiting list. The overall organ shortage remains acute, however. \nThe transplant data set was a version used early in the analysis, transplant2 has several additions and corrections, and was the final data set and matches the paper.

These are the data which was collected in that study. \nMothers were classified by age. Most groups correspond to the age in years but the first group comprises all mothers with ages in the range 15-17 and the last is those with ages 46-49.

This excess DNA thickens the mucus, which then cannot be cleared from the lung by the cilia. The accumulation leads to exacerbations of respiratory symptoms and progressive deterioration of lung function. At the time of this study more than 90% of cystic fibrosis patients eventually died of lung disease. \nDeoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is a human enzyme normally present in the mucus of human lungs that digests extracellular DNA. Genentech, Inc. cloned a highly purified recombinant DNase I (rhDNase or Pulmozyme) which when delivered to the lungs in an aerosolized form cuts extracellular DNA, reducing the viscoelasticity of airway secretions and improving clearance. In 1992 the company conducted a randomized double-blind trial comparing rhDNase to placebo. Patients were then monitored for pulmonary exacerbations, along with measures of lung volume and flow. The primary endpoint was the time until first pulmonary exacerbation; however, data on all exacerbations were collected for 169 days. \nThe definition of an exacerbation was an infection that required the use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Subjects had 0–5 such episodes during the trial, those with more than one have multiple rows in the data set, those with none have NA for the IV start and end times. A few subjects were infected at the time of enrollment, subject 173 for instance has a first infection interval of -21 to 7. We do not count this first infection as an \"event\", and the subject first enters the risk set at day 7. Subjects who have an event are not considered to be at risk for another event during the course of antibiotics, nor for an additional 6 days after they end. (If the symptoms reappear immediately after cessation then from a medical standpoint this would not be a new infection.) \nThis data set reproduces the data in Therneau and Grambsch, is does not exactly reproduce those in Therneau and Hamilton due to data set updates.

Subsequently epidemiological studies of the disorder have consistently shown an earlier onset in men than in women.

The early onset type is assumed to be largely a disorder of men and the late onset largely a disorder of women. ",

The sleep of mental patients was measured without hypnotic (Control) and after treatment with one of three drugs: L. hyoscyamine hydrobromide (L_hyoscyamine), L. hyoscine hydrobromide (L_hyoscyine), and a mixture (racemic) form, DL_hyoscine, called atropine. The L (levo) and D (detro) form of a given molecule are optical isomers (mirror images). \nThe drugs were given on alternate evenings, and the hours of sleep were compared with the intervening control night. Each of the drugs was tested in this manner a varying number of times in each subject. The average number of hours of sleep for each treatment is the response. \nStudent (1908) used these data to illustrate the paired-sample t-test in small samples, testing the hypothesis that the mean difference between a given drug and the control condition was zero. This data set became well known when used by Fisher (1925). Both Student and Fisher had problems labeling the drugs correctly (see Senn & Richardson (1994)), and consequently came to wrong conclusions. \nBut as well, the sample sizes (number of nights) for each mean differed widely, ranging from 3-9, and this was not taken into account in their analyses. To allow weighted analyses, the number of observations for each mean is contained in the data frame CushnyPeeblesN. ",

Milgram's subjects were asked to monitor the answers of a \"learner\" and to push a button to deliver shocks whenever the learner gave a wrong answer. The more wrong answers, the more powerful the shock. Even Milgram himself was surprised by the results: Every one of his subjects ended up delivering what they thought was a dangerous 300-volt shock to a slow \"learner\" as punishment for repeated wrong answers. \n\nEven though the \"shocks\" were not real and the \"learner\" was in on the secret, the results triggered a hot debate about ethics and experiments with human subjects. To study attitudes on this issue, Harvard graduate student Maryann de Mateo conducted a randomized comparative experiment. Her subjects were 37 high school teachers who did not know about the Milgram study. Using chance, Maryann assigned each teacher to one of three treatment groups:\n\nGroup 1: Actual results. Each subject in this group read a description of Milgram's study, including the actual results that every subject delivered the highest possible \"shock.\" \n\nGroup 2: Many complied. Each subject read the same description given to the subjects in Group 1, except that the actual results were replaced by fake results, that many but not all subjects complied. \n\nGroup 3. Most refused. For subjects in this group, the fake results said that most subjects refused to comply. \n\nAfter reading the description, each subject was asked to rate the study according to how ethical they thought it was, from 1 (not at all ethical) to 9 (completely ethical.)

If the current was indeed quantal then it would be expected that the distribution of the current amplitude would be multimodal with modes at regular intervals. The modes would be expected to decrease in magnitude for higher current amplitudes. ",

The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate this type of seaweed to survive. A study was done to try to determine whether chemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract the larvae. Seawater was collected over a patch of this kind of seaweed at 5-minute intervals as the tide was coming in and, presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The idea was that as more seawater came in, the concentration of the chemicals was reduced. Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts. Fifteen larvae were then introduced to this seawater to see what percentage metamorphosed (an indication that the desired chemical was detected). ",

The data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest 1/8th) of the plants in each pair. \nIn the Design of Experiments, Fisher (1935) used these data to illustrate a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean difference, cross - self). Later in the book (section 21), he used this data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation test, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a positive or negative sign.

Nitrofen is no longer in commercial use in the U.S., having been the first pesticide to be withdrawn due to tetragenic effects. \nThe data here come from an experiment to measure the reproductive toxicity of nitrofen on a species of zooplankton (Ceriodaphnia dubia). 50 animals were randomized into batches of 10 and each batch was put in a solution with a measured concentration of nitrofen.

This datafile gives information about the amount of sea ice in the arctic region as measured in September (the time when the amount of ice is at its least) since 1979. The basic research question is to see if we can use time to model the amount of sea ice. \nIn fact, there are two ways to measure the amount of sea ice: Area and Extent. Area measures the actual amount of space taken up by ice. Extent measures the area inside the outer boundaries created by the ice. If there are areas inside the outer boundaries that are not ice (think about a slice of swiss cheese), then the Extent will be a larger number than the Area. In fact, this is almost always true. ",

Gilgais are natural gentle depressions in otherwise flat land, and sometimes seem to be regularly distributed. The data collection was stimulated by the question: are these patterns reflected in soil properties? At each of 365 sampling locations on a linear grid of 4 meters spacing, samples were taken at depths 0-10 cm, 30-40 cm and 80-90 cm below the surface. pH, electrical conductivity and chloride content were measured on a 1:5 soil:water extract from each sample.

The locations were paired to account for factors such as traffic volume and type of road. One site in each pair had a sign erected warning of the dangers of speeding and asking drivers to slow down. No action was taken at the second site. Three sets of measurements were taken at each site. Each set of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites have exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after the sign had been in place for some time. ",

During its preparation, several accounts of its formidable strength were circulated to reassure allied powers of Spain or to intimidate its enemies. One such account was given by Paz Salas et Alvarez (1588). The intent was bring the forces of Spain to invade England, overthrow Queen Elizabeth I, and re-establish Spanish control of the Netherlands. However the Armada was not as fortunate as hoped: it was all destroyed in one week's fighting. \ne Falguerolles (2008) reports the table given here as Armada as an early example of data to which multivariate methods might be applied.

This 1D line graph, from Langren (1644), is believed to be the first known graph of statistical data (Friendly etal., 2010). It provides a compelling example of the notions of statistical variability and bias. \nThe data frame Langren1644 gives the estimates and other information derived from the previously known 1644 graph. It turns out that van Langren produced other versions of this graph, as early as 1628. The data frame Langren.all gives the estimates derived from all known versions of this graph. ",

The data represent the flight response to helicopter \"overflights\" to see what the relationship between the proximity of a flight, both lateral and altitudinal, would be to the propensity of the Brant to flee the area. For this experiment, air traffic was restricted to helicopters because previous study had ascertained that helicopters created more radical flight response than other aircraft. The data are in FlightResponse. Each case represents a flock of Brant that has been observed during one overflight in the study. Flocks were determined observationally as contiguous collections of Brants, flock sizes varying from 10 to 30,000 birds. ",

The report \"A first study of the influence of parental alcholism on the physique and ability of their offspring\" was an ambitious attempt to the new methods of statistics to bear on an important question of social policy, to see if the hypothesis that children were damaged by parental alcoholism would stand up to statistical scrutiny. \nWorking with his assistant, Ethel M. Elderton, Pearson collected voluminous data in Edinburgh and Manchester on many aspects of health, stature, intelligence, etc. of children classified according to the drinking habits of their parents. His conclusions where almost invariably negative: the tendency of parents to drink appeared unrelated to any thing he had measured. \nThe firestorm that this report set off is well described by Stigler (1999), Chapter 1. The data set DrinksWages is just one of Pearsons many tables, that he published in a letter to The Times, August 10, 1910. ",

The Trial of the Pyx was the final, ceremonial stage in a process designed to ensure that the weight and quality of gold and silver coins from the mint met the standards for coinage. \nAt regular intervals, coins would be taken from production and deposited into a box called the Pyx. When a Trial of the Pyx was called, the contents of the Pyx would be counted, weighed and assayed for content, and the results would be compared with the standard set for the Royal Mint. \nThe data frame Pyx gives the results for the year 1848 (Great Britain, 1848) in which 10,000 gold sovereigns were assayed. The coins in each bag were classified according to the deviation from the standard content of gold for each coin, called the Remedy, R = 123 * (12/5760) = .25625, in grains, for a single sovereign.

JOBS II is a randomized field experiment that investigates the efficacy of a job training intervention on unemployed workers. The program is designed to not only increase reemployment among the unemployed but also enhance the mental health of the job seekers. In the JOBS II field experiment, 1,801 unemployed workers received a pre-screening questionnaire and were then randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Those in the treatment group participated in job-skills workshops. In the workshops, respondents learned job-search skills and coping strategies for dealing with setbacks in the job-search process. Those in the control condition received a booklet describing job-search tips. In follow-up interviews, the two key outcome variables were measured; a continuous measure of depressive symptoms based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and a binary variable, representing whether the respondent had become employed.

                            "description": "Holzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general factor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are original 14 * 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 *9 matrix used as an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 * 9 matrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 * 16 correlation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are both 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests. \nHolzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one general factor and several group factors) for mental abilities. This is a nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that can be analyzed using the omega function or using sem. The bifactor model is typically used in measures of cognitive ability. \nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the omega function to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman transformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a confirmatory model using omegaSem. Another way is to do a regular factor analysis and use either a bifactor or biquartimin rotation. These latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011) bifactor and biquartimin transformations. The bifactor rotation suffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and thus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be preferred. \nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed tests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355. \nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive abilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog (2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in the LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. \nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is discussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as example in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS. These nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on other data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and Reasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) but were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two. McDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of 17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213. \nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is the data set of 4,175 students reported by Professor Brigham of Princeton to the College Entrance Examination Board. This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but is included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum likelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor solution. \nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thburstone (1941) for his example of interbattery factor analysis. \nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of psychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based upon >35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care Provideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays (2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases. \nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3), Doctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9), Getting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16). \nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to form the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213 respectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words, space, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote memory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data set. \nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the Harman data set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from Holzinger used by Harman link{Harman.Holzinger} as well as 8 affective variables from link{burt}. ",

This is supported by the 10.6 percent growth per year in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita seen in the standard GDP estimates from 1940 to 1945. It is also supported by the rapid decline in unemployment during the war. \nHowever, no comparable growth spurts in GDP per capita catch the eye in a plot of log(GDP per capita) from 1790 to 2015, whether associated with a war or not, using the Measuring Worth data. The only other features of that plot that seem visually comparable are the economic disaster of Herbert Hoover's presidency (when GDP per capital fell by 10 percent per year, 1929-1932), the impressive growth of the US economy during the first seven years of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (6.4 percent per year, 1933-1940), and the post-World War II recession (when GDP per capita fell by 7.9 percent per year, 1945-1947). \nCloser inspection of this plot suggests that the US economy has generally grown faster after FDR than before. This might plausibly be attributed to \"The Keynesian Ascendancy 1939-1979\". \nUnemployment dropped during the First World War as it did during WW2. Comparable data are not available for the U.S. during other major wars, most notably the American Civil War and the Mexican-American War. \nThis data set provides a platform for testing the effects of presidency, war, and Keynes. It does this by combining the numbers for US population and real GDP per capital dollars from Measuring Worth with the presidency and a list of major wars and an estimate of the battle deaths by year per million population. US unemployment is also considered. ",

A quarrel consists of one pair of belligerents, and is identified by its beginning date and magnitude (log 10 of the number of deaths). Neither actor in a quarrel is identified by name. \nBecause Richardson took a dyad of belligerents as his unit, a given war, such as World War I or World War II comprises multiple observations, for all pairs of belligerents. For example, there are forty-four pairs of belligerents coded for World War I. \nFor each quarrel, the nominal variables include the type of quarrel, as well as political, cultural, and economic similarities and dissimilarities between the pair of combatants. \n",

Jury duty for this court is two weeks long, so Tom must bring together a new group of potential jurors twenty-six times a year. Random sampling methods are used to obtain a sample of registered voters in Franklin County every two weeks, and these individuals are sent a summons to appear for jury duty. One of the most difficult aspects of Tom's job is to get those registered voters who receive a summons to actually appear at the courthouse for jury duty. This dataset contains the 1998 and 2000 data for the percentages of individuals who reported for jury duty after receiving a summons. The reporting dates vary slightly from year to year, so they are coded sequentially from 1, the first group to report in January, to 26, the last group to report in December. A variety of methods were used after 1998 to try to increase participation rates. ",

About 2.3% of the votes cast in Florida were awarded to other candidates. One of those other candidates was Pat Buchanan, who did much better in Palm Beach County than he did anywhere else. Palm Beach County used a unique \"butterfly ballot\" that had candidate names on either side of the page with \"chads\" to be punched in the middle. This non-standard ballot seemed to confuse some voters, who punched votes for Buchanan that may have been intended for a different candidate.

The self assessment (self, in the data set), \"How free do you think [name/you] [is/are] to express [him-her/your]self without fear of government reprisal?\" was first asked of the survey respondent with respect to him or herself, and then after each of vignette.

She frequently publishes her opinion in newspapers, criticizing decisions by officials and calling for change. She sees little reason these actions could lead to government reprisal. \nvign2[Michael] disagrees with many of the government's policies. Though he knows criticism is frowned upon, he doesn't believe the government would punish someone for expressing critical views. He makes his opinion known on most issues without regard to who is listening. \nvign3[Bob] has political views at odds with the government. He has heard of people occasionally being arrested for speaking out against the government, and government leaders sometimes make political speeches condemning those who criticize. He sometimes writes letters to newspapers about politics, but he is careful not to use his real name. \nvign4[Connie] does not like the government's stance on many issues. She has a friend who was arrested for being too openly critical of governmental leaders, and so she avoids voicing her opinions in public places. \nvign5[Vito] disagrees with many of the government's policies, and is very careful about whom he says this to, reserving his real opinions for family and close friends only. He knows several men who have been taken away by government officials for saying negative things in public. \nvign6[Sonny] lives in fear of being harassed for his political views. Everyone he knows who has spoken out against the government has been arrested or taken away. He never says a word about anything the government does, not even when he is at home alone with his family. ",

For a discussion of these and related data, see Fox (2009). \nFor more detail, see the CRAN packages data on Github maintained by Hadley Wickham. This contains the description file of every package uploaded to CRAN prior to the date of Hadley's most recent update. The current maintainer of the Ecdat and Ecfun packages would consider contributions along the following lines: \n1. It might be nice to have a more complete dataset or datasets showing CRAN growth. This might include code fitting multiple models and predicting future growth with error bounds computed using Bayesian Model Averaging. These model fits might make an interesting addition to the examples in this help file. With a little more effort, it might make an interesting note for R Journal. Functions written to fit those models might be added to the Ecfun package. \n2. It might be nice to have a function in Ecfun to download the CRAN packages data from Github and convert it to a format suitable for updating this dataset. \nThe current maintainer for Ecdat and Ecfun (Spencer Graves) might be willing to accept code and documentation for this but is not ready to do it himself at the present time.

The basic question was whether exposing sand with oil in it (think oil spill) to ultrasound could help the oil deapsorb from it better than sand that was not exposed to ultrasound. There were two levels of ultrasound tested (5 minutes and 10 minutes) and two levels of oil (5 ml and 10 ml). There was also a question of whether exposure to salt water or fresh water made a difference so half the samples had salt water, the others distilled water. Each combination of factor levels was replicated 5 times. There were also an equivalent number of control observations run, all factors being the same but without any exposure to ultrasound. Each experimental run was paired with an appropriate control run and the response variable is the difference in the amount of oil removed in the experimental run and the control run. ",

In addition, the students took an exam on Swahili. From each province, the students were from 6 schools (3 girls schools and 3 boys schools) with 40 students sampled at each school, so half of the students from each province were males and the other half females. The survey instrument contained 40 statements about attitudes towards Swahili and students rated their level of agreement to each. Of these questions, 30 were positive questions and the remaining 10 were negative questions. On an individual question the most positive response would be assigned a value of 5 while the most negative response would be assigned a value of 1. By summing (adding) the responses to each question, we can find an overall Attitude Score for each student. The highest possible score would be 200 (an individual who gave the most positive possible response to every question). The lowest possible score would be 40 (an individual who gave the most negative response to every question). ",

Soon after its production the tau particle decays into various collections of more stable particles. About 86% of the time the decay involves just one charged particle. This rate has been measured independently 13 times. \nThe one-charged-particle event is made up of four major modes of decay as well as a collection of other events. The four main types of decay are denoted rho, pi, e and mu. These rates have been measured independently 6, 7, 14 and 19 times respectively. Due to physical constraints each experiment can only estimate the composite one-charged-particle decay rate or the rate of one of the major modes of decay. \nEach experiment consists of a major research project involving many years work. One of the goals of the experiments was to estimate the rate of decay due to events other than the four main modes of decay. These are uncertain events and so cannot themselves be observed directly.
