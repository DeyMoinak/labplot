(1977) at Stanford University. After reaching a stage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients were randomized into two groups. The first group received maintenance chemotherapy and the second group did not. The aim of the study was to see if maintenance chemotherapy increased the length of the remission. The data here formed a preliminary analysis which was conducted in October 1974.",

Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased chance of death from melanoma. Patients were followed until the end of 1977. ",

It is common to operate on the patient to get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an accurate assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery. \nFor a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible predictor variables were measured before surgery. The patients then had surgery to determine nodal involvement. It was required to see if nodal involvement could be accurately predicted from the predictor variables and which ones were most important. ",

Larger values of this measurement are known to be linked to the defective gene and it was hypothesized that larger values might also be linked to a progressive shift away from right-handednesss. Each woman also filled in a questionnaire regarding which hand they used for various tasks. From these questionnaires a measure of hand preference was found for each mother. The scale of this measure goes from 1, indicating someone who always favours their right hand, to 8, indicating someone who always favours their left hand.

These are the data which was collected in that study. \nMothers were classified by age. Most groups correspond to the age in years but the first group comprises all mothers with ages in the range 15-17 and the last is those with ages 46-49.

If the current was indeed quantal then it would be expected that the distribution of the current amplitude would be multimodal with modes at regular intervals.

The data here cover 90 years from January 1903 until December 1992. \nThe Manaus gauge is tied in with an arbitrary bench mark of 100m set in the steps of the Municipal Prefecture; gauge readings are usually referred to sea level, on the basis of a mark on the steps leading to the Parish Church (Matriz), which is assumed to lie at an altitude of 35.874 m according to observations made many years ago under the direction of Samuel Pereira, an engineer in charge of the Manaus Sanitation Committee Whereas such an altitude cannot, by any means, be considered to be a precise datum point, observations have been provisionally referred to it.

Nitrofen is no longer in commercial use in the U.S., having been the first pesticide to be withdrawn due to tetragenic effects. \nThe data here come from an experiment to measure the reproductive toxicity of nitrofen on a species of zooplankton (Ceriodaphnia dubia). 50 animals were randomized into batches of 10 and each batch was put in a solution with a measured concentration of nitrofen. Then the number of live offspring in each of the three broods to each animal was recorded. ",

The locations were paired to account for factors such as traffic volume and type of road. One site in each pair had a sign erected warning of the dangers of speeding and asking drivers to slow down. No action was taken at the second site. Three sets of measurements were taken at each site. Each set of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites have exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after the sign had been in place for some time. ",

Soon after its production the tau particle decays into various collections of more stable particles. About 86% of the time the decay involves just one charged particle. This rate has been measured independently 13 times. \nThe one-charged-particle event is made up of four major modes of decay as well as a collection of other events. The four main types of decay are denoted rho, pi, e and mu. These rates have been measured independently 6, 7, 14 and 19 times respectively. Due to physical constraints each experiment can only estimate the composite one-charged-particle decay rate or the rate of one of the major modes of decay. \nEach experiment consists of a major research project involving many years work. One of the goals of the experiments was to estimate the rate of decay due to events other than the four main modes of decay. These are uncertain events and so cannot themselves be observed directly.
