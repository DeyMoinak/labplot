    "description": "Charles Darwin conducted an experiment to examine the superiority of cross-fertilized plants over self-fertilized plants. 15 pairs of plants were used. Each pair consisted of one cross-fertilized plant and one self-fertilized plant which germinated at the same time and grew in the same pot. The plants were measured at a fixed time after planting and the difference in heights between the cross- and self-fertilized plants are recorded in eighths of an inch.",
