  "description": "A clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia was conducted by Embury et al. (1977) at Stanford University. After reaching a stage of remission through treatment by chemotherapy, patients were randomized into two groups. The first group received maintenance chemotherapy and the second group did not. The aim of the study was to see if maintenance chemotherapy increased the length of the remission. The data here formed a preliminary analysis which was conducted in October 1974.",
