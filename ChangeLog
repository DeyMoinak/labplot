	* Transparently import compressed data files.
	* In xy-curve the points may not be connected by the line if there are NANs in-between. This behaviour is controlled by the parameter "skip gaps".
	* Multiplier of Pi format of the plot axis for periodical functions.
	* New operations on columns in Spreadsheet - reverse, drop values and mask values.
	* Formula used to generate the values in a column is stored and can be changed/adjusted in the formula dialog afterwards.
	* Curve filling: the area below, under, left to or right to the curve can be filled.
	* Support for multiple variables in "Function Values"-dialog - new data in the spreadsheet can be calculated out of multiple columns.

Performance improvements:
	* Speeded up the creation of new columns during the import

Bug fixes:
	* Fixed wrong behaviour when doing "zoom&select" in a plot and then deselecting the plot - it was not possible anymore to select the plot again on the worksheet.

-----2.0.2-----
New features:
	* Plot 2D-curves defined by mathematical equations in cartesian and polar coordinates or via a parametric equation.
	* Linear and non-linear regression analysis. Several predefined fit-models are provided. User-defined models are also possible.
	* Besides fixed worksheet sizes (predefined sizes like A4 etc. or user-defined), complete view size can be used. All sizes are automatically adjusted on resize.
	* Different axis arrow types.
	* "select region and zoom in", "select x-region and zoom in", "select y-region and zoom in" functions for cartesian plot.
	* Rounded border for several worksheet objects  (plot area, legend etc.)
	* Hover effect for axis, curve and text label.
	* Added a MessageBox - ask befor deleting worksheet objects.
	* Added three new types for drop lines - "zero baseline", "min baseline" and "max baseline"
	* Fill the selection in Spreadsheet with a constant value provided by the user
	* Fill columns with uniform and non-uniform random numbers, several distributions are available.
	* Fill columns with function values
	* Allow custom resolutions for PNG-export
	* Export of the spreadsheet to a text file.
	* Simultaneous zooming and navigation accross multiple plots.
	* Implemented "Powers of 10/2/e" for the axis tick labels

Bug fixes:
	* Don't crash when trying to create a plot in case no rc-file was installed.
	* Don't allow to select unwanted objects in TreeViewComboBox in ImportDialog and XYCurveDock.
	* Corrected painting of background images in plot area and legend.
	* BUG: 330723 - fixed weird selection in spreadsheet.

-----2.0.1-----
Bug fix release. Solved issues:
	* Fixed wrong scaling of legend's text labels in pdf-export
	* Fixed memory corruption in CartesianPlotDock that can lead to crashes

-----2.0.0-----
First stable release of LabPlot2. LabPlot2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot1 and lacks in this release a lot of features available in the predecessor. On the other hand, the GUI and the usability is more superior as compared to LabPlot1 and there are several new features that were not available in LabPlot1.

Brief summary of features and capabilities of LabPlot2 implemented in the first release:
	* project-based management of data
	* created objects are organized in a tree and are visualized and accessible in the project explorer
	* for a better management of objects, additional folders and sub-folders can be created within a project 
	* spreadsheet with very basic functionality is available for manual data entry
	* "file data source" can be used to import a file and to let LabPlot2 watch for changes in that file
	* external data from an ascii file can be also directly imported to a spreadsheet for further editing
	* worksheet is the main object where plots, labels etc. are placed on
	* several zooming functions for the worksheet
	* only cartesian plot is implemented in the first release
	* arbitrary number of freely positionable axes is possible
	* xy-curve is implemented. As the data source for the x- and y-values columns either from a spreadsheet
	  or from a file data source can be used
	* several zooming and "movement" functions are available for the plots which help to navigate through data
	* legend for xy-plots
	* a lot of properties of the worksheet elements can be edited in a very easy way in the corresponding dock widgets
	* plots on the worksheet can be put into a horizontal, vertical or grid layouts
	* export of worksheet (entire worksheet or current seleciton) to pdf, eps, png and svg
