NSL - Numerical and Statistical Library

A collection of numerical and statistics functions extending the GNU Scientific library (GSL).
NSL is currently part of LabPlot but may be a separate library in the future if the API is not changing anymore.
NSL is written in plain C.

Compile tests with "make".
